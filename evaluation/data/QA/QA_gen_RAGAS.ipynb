commerce platforms. depreciation expense increased year - over - year based on our nancial system investments with the remainder of the increase being driven by multiple items, none of which were individually signi cant. in scal 2011, our operating expenses increased 1. 7 % compared to scal 2010, while net sales increased 3. 4 % during scal 2011 compared to scal 2010. operating expenses grew at a slower rate than net sales in scal 2011 due to improved labor productivity and organizational changes made at the end of scal 2010 designed to strengthen and streamline our operations, as well as a reduction in certain incentive plan expenses. operating income as a result of the factors discussed above and our investment in price for products sold in our retail operations, which reduced our gross margin, our operating income increased 4. 0 % and 6. 4 % in scal 2012 and 2011, respectively, while net sales increased 5. 9 % and 3. 4 % in scal 2012 and 2011, respectively. returns return on investment management believes return on investment ( roi ) is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how e ectively walmart is deploying its assets. trends in roi can uctuate over time as management balances long - term potential strategic initiatives with any possible short - term impacts. roi was 18. 6 % and 19. 2 % for scal 2012 and 2011, respectively. the decrease in roi in scal 2012 from scal 2011 was due primarily to additional investments in property, plant and equipment, global ecommerce and higher inventories, as well as price investment ahead of full realization of productivity improvements. in future periods, productivity gains are expected to align more closely with price invest - ments. additionally, to a lesser degree, roi was positively impacted by currency translation uctuations, but o set by acquisitions. we de ne roi as adjusted operating income ( operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense ) for the scal year divided by average invested capital during that period. we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average', metadata={'source': './file.csv', 'row': 0}), Document(page_content='##varies across the retail industry. as a result, our calculation of comparable store and club sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. in discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u. s. dollar. we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates, and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates. throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluc -

mart and sams club also led the corporate drive to assist in hurricane relief with $ 18 million in cash donations to aid emergency efforts. an additional $ 8. 5 million was raised in our stores and clubs through the generosity of our customers. wal - mart has demonstrated a continued commitment to our associ - ates and the communities we serve by providing ongoing assistance to those affected by the hurricanes. some of the most visible images of wal - marts efforts were the truck convoys carrying critical supplies to affected areas and hundreds of wal - mart associate volunteers help - ing to distribute those supplies. wal - mart was often the rst relief to arrive at staging sites, command centers and shelters in the devastated areas. the company providedduring this time, we were asked by governments, relief agencies and communities to help. and look what happened. we were showered with gratitude, kindness, and acknowledgements. this was wal - mart at its best. lee scott, october 2005environmental initiatives through acres for americasm, wal - mart committed $ 35 million over 10 years to conserve at least one acre of wildlife habitat for every acre developed by wal -
