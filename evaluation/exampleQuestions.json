In addition, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $126 million related to this transaction. The Company recorded an additional loss on this disposition of $153 million during fiscal year 2008. See Note 6, “Acquisitions and Disposals,” for additional information about this transaction. The Company plans to deduct the tax loss realized on the disposition of its German operations as an ordinary worthless stock deduction. Final resolution of the amount and character of the deduction may result in the recognition of additional tax benefits of up to $1.7 billion which may be included in discontinued operations in future periods. The Internal Revenue Service often challenges the characterization of such deductions. If the loss is characterized as a capital loss, any such capital loss could only be realized by being offset against future capital gains and would expire in 2012. Any deferred tax asset, net of its related valuation allowance, resulting from the characterization of the loss as capital may be included with the Company’s non-current assets of discontinued operations",
